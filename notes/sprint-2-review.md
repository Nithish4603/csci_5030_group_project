# Sprint 2 Review

** What is done? **
- Users can register and login. The email and hashed password are stored in an sqlite3 database after login.
- Added settings button that allows user to change their username. Each user is given a default username after registering. Defaults to "myspace Tom"
- Displayed username in home page after login. 
- Created html layout page for register, login, and layout (homepage for user).  





** What has slipped? **
- Completed all goals for this sprint! Yay!


** Feedback **
- Flash error message on login/register if email already registered or wrong email/password combination when logging in
- Redirect user to home page after submitting username change
- Add logout button to home page
- Work on UI. Room for improvement.
