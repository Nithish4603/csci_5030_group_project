# Sprint 1 Review Notes

## Completed

- The product fulfilled the 1st user story task. The application opens a webpage that shows the number of times the page has been visited. 
- Application uses a python flask implementation that handels back-end http requests and routes the user to their intended webpage (if it exists). 
- Application contains a single webpage (the index '\')
- Viewing and storing of the site counter was done using an sqlite3 database connection and a table in the sql file
- In total, a very simple, but working product was developed from the first sprint that lays the foundation for upcoming sprints.

## Feeback
- The site is very plain looking. We want to make the front-end work a primary goal in the next sprint. 
- The web application work is still vague to many on the team. We need to focus on getting up to speed so that the next sprint will be as productive as possible. This includes learning 'shell', running the flask implementation by each member, going through the tutorial, and practicing using git. 
- There was a lack of communication in the first sprint until the day before the sprint end date. This is an ineffective way to work. We all need to view discord regularly and communicate any issues we are having so that we can effectively finish sprint goals.
- The SQL commands with the sqlite3 package in python can be difficult to understand. SQLalchemy may be a good option to wrap the sqlite3 commands to make reading and implementing db calls easier. 
- (in addition to this) we are currently working on making up for some of the mistakes we made in this process. we are currently working to make our project better than before like adding a html file and adding user login. we might add this to a new folder as 2nd release.
