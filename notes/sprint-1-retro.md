# Sprint 1 Retro Notes

## Keep Doing
- Keep reading information up the web application process. Many of use are new to this, but we should always be trying to improve the product and our knowledge through external resources.
- Keep checking the Trelo board and make sure it is up-to-date with whatever we are working on. 

## Stop Doing
- Waiting until the last day of the sprint to notify that something is an issue. Unless it just came up due to a bug in a new code push.  

# Start Doing
- Learn shell commands, git commands, and the flask implementation. 
- Communicate any issues as early as possible. That way the issue can be resolved before the sprint ends.
