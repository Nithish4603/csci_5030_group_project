# Sprint 2 Retrospective

** What should we keep doing? **
- Keep working on the UI. The UI could still be improved. 
- Always keep the sprint plan in mind.
 

** What should we stop doing? **
- Resolve conflicts right away. Try to minimize them by looking ahead at files we are merging back to the develop branch. 

** What should we start doing? **
- Improve upon our git command line skills. 
- Check the trelo board more often and move tasks to each column when they progress. 
- Re-initialize database if we have made changes to it. 
- If someone completes a task, update team members in discord.
